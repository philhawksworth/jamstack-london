  - title: Keep Scrolling
    description: > 
      When crafted with intent, scroll-triggered animations can add polish, and make online storytelling feel more immersive – but they can be easily misused or overused.
      
      
      Let’s take a look at scroll-based animation together.


      We'll dig into the Intersection Observer API, the upcoming CSS Scroll-linked animations spec, and GreenSock's ScrollTrigger – but more importantly, how to create responsible animations that evoke delight rather than frustration.
